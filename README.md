# Project Overview

In this project a web-based application that reads RSS feeds was given and test suite using [***Jasmine Framework***][1] was to be written.

# Running the App

There is no need to install anything. To run the project simply open the **index.html** in any web browser. An app containing a list of RSS feeds and a **gray** area with ***Jasmine*** written on it will appear. The app will perform some tasks by itself and every time it completes each task a green dot or red cross will appear in the *gray* area depending on whether the test failed or was successful. When all tests are completed, the results will be displayed in the *gray* area. The results will contain the number of tests, the number of tests failed and a brief description of each test. **./jasmine/spec/feed reader.js** can be explored for viewing the test cases.
